Day 1
```
Going from single core to multi core 
- single core is clocked at 2f
- multi core is clocked at f

- both have same amount of compute throughput 2f
heat is different 8f^3 for single core and 2f^3 for multi core
- reduce heat equals more battery life
```

Day 2
```
Starting monday meet in ISB: 878


```

Day 3
```

```



Day 4
```
Three distinct sections
- hardware software and presentations
```


Day 5
```
Assembly language, how parrallelism using a pipeline architechture can increase your throughput. In  theory
```
